# GA-Short-term-Optimal-Dispatch-of-Reservoirs
Application of gradient descent algorithm to short-term optimal scheduling of reservoirs

采用遗传算法进行多能互补系统短期优化调度，多能互补系统包括水电、风电、光伏，调度目标为日内负荷波动性最小

A genetic algorithm is used for short-term optimal scheduling of a multi-energy complementary system, which includes hydropower, wind power, and photovoltaic, with the scheduling objective of minimizing intra-day load volatility
